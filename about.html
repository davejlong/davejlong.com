    <p>I have been developing web applications since 2008, when I fell into the web industry by chance. Since then, I have worked on multiple websites and applications spanning multiple brands and industries. Many of my side projects have been open sourced on <a href="http://github.com/davejlong">GitHub</a> including my favorite code, <a href="http://github.com/davejlong/cf-utils.vim">CF Utils</a>, a Vim plugin to add in better ColdFusion support to Vim.</p>

    <p>I live in Wallingford, CT with my wife, Torrie; dog, an adorable Basset Hound named Peaches; two cats, Xena and Patches; and rabit, Thumper. When I'm not developing, I'm either out galavanting with friends or in Uganda, Africa with Torrie. I've been doing missions work to Uganda for the past foud years, working with the <a href="http://kampalachildren.org">Kampala Children's Centre</a>, and have made three trips to visit and work at the center.</p>
