      <p>When I started working with <span>Recruitics</span>, I had no idea what it would be like to drive 90 miles a day for work. I live in central Connecticut and practically work in New York, which ends up being about 45 miles each direction for my commute. I do work remotely sometimes, but I&#8217;m the kind of person who just enjoys being around other people. Over the past couple of months, I have come up with some tips that I try to follow myself, and I figured I&#8217;d share them.</p>

<h4 id='tip_1_find_a_good_book'>Tip #1: Find a good book</h4>

<p>Welcome to the world of the future, where &#8220;find a great book&#8221; is allowed to be one of these tips. I&#8217;m not talking about a reading book; I&#8217;m talking about an audio book. Since starting my commuting I have gone through two audio books (Under The Dome and The Gunslinger by Stephen King). When you get really into a good audiobook, the drive can seem much shorter than it really is. There are some great places to get audiobooks and some are even free.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Local library</strong> is a great place to get audiobooks, especially in Connecticut. Most Connecticut libraries are interconnected, so if one doesn&#8217;t have an audiobook, they can probably get it for you.</li>

<li><strong>Audible</strong> has a ton of good books and the prices aren&#8217;t too bad, compared to buying audiobooks.</li>

<li><strong>Any local book store</strong> will probably have a selection of audiobooks. They&#8217;re expensive, but if you really want to own audiobooks, then that&#8217;s the place to look.</li>
</ul>

<p>A nice, free alternative to audiobooks is to find a podcast to listen to. <a href='http://thechangelog.com' title='The Changelog Podcast'>The Changelog</a> is a great podcast for developers who are interested in everything across the industry.</p>

<h4 id='tip_2_get_waze'>Tip #2: Get Waze</h4>

<p><a href='http://waze.com' title='Waze GPS'>Waze</a> is a hugely fun way to navigate along the drive as well as being really practical. I&#8217;ve never used a better GPS that gave me traffic information, and getting to level up the more you drive makes it the perfect companion to any super commuter.</p>

<h4 id='tip_3_lookup_mass_transit_solutions'>Tip #3: Lookup mass transit solutions</h4>

<h4 id='tip_4_dont_become_a_super_commuter'>Tip #4: Don&#8217;t become a super commuter</h4>

      <p>My life has been pretty busy for the past couple of months, and thus I have been pretty much dead to the world in terms of blogging. I&#8217;ve been building up a list of blog post ideas in <a href='http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/'>Wunderlist</a>, but I just haven&#8217;t gotten around to writing them. Part of that was due, also to, the platform I was on. <a href='http://nestacms.com'>Nesta CMS</a> proved to be too much for me, so I decided to move my site. I&#8217;m now running on <a href='http://jekyllrb.com' title='Jekyll Static Site Generator'>Jekyll</a> running on <a href='http://github.com/davejlong/davejlong.github.com' title='Source code for davejlong.com'>GitHub Pages</a>, which I hope will help me to write more.</p>

<p>So the largest thing that has kept me quiet over the past couple of months has been starting a new job. In April, I was asked to join the team at <a href='http://recruitics.com'>Recruitics</a>, a tech startup here in Connecticut connecting recruiters to their applicants in a more social format. I know, I know, we all hate recruiters, which is the exact reason why I took the job. Recruitics isn&#8217;t catering to the recruiters that most developers know of, who are calling and emailing from India, talking about things they know absolutely nothing about. Recruitics is about making recruiters sociable and giving faces to the people providing us jobs. The other goal of Recruitics is to get jobs out to the world through mediums that people actually look for jobs at.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s nothing new that I love <a href='http://git-scm.com' title='Git DVCS'>Git</a>. I&#8217;ve done talks about it, help clients get learn to use it and now I have gotten to start using it in development of <a href='http://recruitics.com' title='Internet Recruitment Marketing'>Recruitics</a>, the company that I am now working for.</p>

<p>When I started with the company version control was the classic rename the file method (index1.cfm, index2.cfm, index3.cfm and index.cfm). This would work fine, except that you end up with tons of copies of files on the server, and what do you do if you forget to make your copy. The second one is easily solved in Git:</p>

<pre><code>git add .
git stash
git checkout -b [branch]
git stash apply</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to <a href='http://github.com/davejlong' title='Hosted Git with GitHub'>GitHub</a>, and the <a href='http://mac.github.com' title='GitHub for Mac'>GitHub GUI Apps</a> everyone has been able to pick up the basics of Git pretty quickly.</p>
